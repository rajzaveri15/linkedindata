Exploring and Analyzing my own LinkedIn Data with Tableau

#### Project Overview
I have always wondered what my LinkedIn account looked like from a bird’s eye view. With this project, I explored and analyzed my own LinkedIn account, particularly my connections, to learn more about my network and my activity on the platform over time. I went about this project by posing a few questions and using Tableau to create visualizations to answer them and gain insights and discoveries. 

#### Description of Dataset
The dataset consists of 6 attributes including first name, last name, email address, company, position, and connected on date (date we became connections) of all 263 of my connections. For my own privacy purposes, I will not share the .csv file. 

#### Summary Questions
1.	What does the running total of my connections over time look like?
2.	What time period did I add the most connections?
3.	Who am I connected with? Am I connected with the right people?
4.	Where do my connections work?

#### Question 1
The first question I asked: What does the running total of my connections over time look like? To answer this question,  I simply created a line graph to display the running total from June 2016 (when I joined LinkedIn) until now.

The line graph showed me more or less what I expected. I had a steady growth in connections until 2020. During the first half of 2020, I took advantage of working from home to use LinkedIn to network extensively and grew my connections exponentially. 

#### Question 2
For the second question, I wanted to find out if the conclusion I made in the first question is in fact true? To verify this, I created a histogram type bar chart to see which time period I gained the most connections.

From the chart, my conclusion was confirmed. During May, June and July of 2020 is when I gained the most connections. I gained 34 connections in May, 32 connections in June, and 15 in July. 

#### Question 3
The third question I asked was a spin-off of my previous question. I wanted to find what time of the year, or which month(s), I added the most connections in. To find this out, I created another bar chart.

From this bar chart, it is clear to tell that during the summertime, around May and June, is when I network the most and add the most connections. 

#### Question 4
For my next question, I wanted to explore my connections even further. I wanted to find out who exactly I was connected. As an aspiring Data Analyst, am I connected with the right people? To answer this, I had to find what portion of my connections worked with Data. This could be any Data Scientists, Analysts, or even Engineers at any level including full-time, part-time, or even interns. To find this out I first created a group from the ‘Position’ measure to contain all Data professionals.  From this group, I create the following pie chart.

The pie chart shows that only 6.49% of my connections are in a Data related position. While this doesn’t look very promising, more analysis is needed on this question because this chart does not properly answer the question I had. That is because many of my connections could be working in a data related position but not have the word ‘Data’ in their title. For example, ‘Business Intelligence’ positions have a lot to do with data as well. This is something that I will explore even further.

#### Question 5
The last question I wanted to explore was where my connections work. I had an idea of what the breakdown would look like, but I wanted to see it visualized and verified. I wanted to see what percentage of my connections worked at a FAANG company, at Penn State University and at Indiana University (my two alma maters). I created two groups containing these connections and then created another pie chart from this.

The roles and locations of all my connections are very diverse. Therefore, it is no surprise that most of them fall in the ‘Others’ category. However, after that, Indiana University is the next highest at 7.87%. Around 5% of my connections work at one of the FAANG companies. And 2.76% work at Penn State University. This was close to what I was expecting. I had expected the Indiana University portion to be larger because I had connected with quite a few of my peers from my university over the last year or so. I was however pleasantly surprised at the number of connections of mine that work at a FAANG company. I did not know what to expect there but was glad to see a somewhat relatively large portion. 

#### Conclusion
Analyzing my own LinkedIn data was something I was glad I did. I learned a lot more about my connections and was given a guiding light on what I need to improve on in terms of professional networking. This is not the end, however. I will continue expanding on this analysis by asking even more questions (both breadth and depth), creating more visualizations to answer them, and learning even more.
